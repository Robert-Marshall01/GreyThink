PowerApp privacy notes

On-device ML & telemetry

- ML best-window suggestions run on your device only when you enable them in Settings.
- By default, no telemetry or usage data is sent anywhere. If you choose to opt in to aggregated telemetry, only anonymized, aggregated statistics (counts, histograms of accepted suggestions, and summary estimates) will be transmitted, and no personal identifiers or raw timestamps will be included.
- The app provides clear opt-in control in Settings and you can remove any locally stored model files at any time.

If you have questions about privacy, file an issue or reach out via the repository issue tracker.
