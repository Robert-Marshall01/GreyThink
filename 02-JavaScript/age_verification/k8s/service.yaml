# Service Configuration for Age Verification
# ============================================
# NOTE: This application is a CLI tool that requires 
# interactive terminal input (stdin/tty). It does NOT 
# expose any HTTP/TCP ports or network services.
#
# A Kubernetes Service is typically NOT needed for this 
# type of application. This file is provided as a template
# in case the application is modified to include a web 
# interface or API in the future.
# ============================================
