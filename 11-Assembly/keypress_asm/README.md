# keypress_asm

Minimal Assembly project: `keypress_asm`.

- Description: A small assembly-language example (source: `keypress_asm.asm`) demonstrating handling of keypress/input. The repository contains a single source file.
- Author: Robert-Marshall01
- License: MIT (see `LICENSE`)

Usage
- Inspect `keypress_asm.asm` for details about what it does and which assembler it targets.
- Build: use your preferred assembler/linker (NASM, MASM, TASM, etc.). Example workflows vary by toolchain and platform.

Examples (adjust to your toolchain/platform):

PowerShell / NASM (32-bit / generic):
```
# Assemble (example)
nasm -f win32 keypress_asm.asm -o keypress_asm.obj
# Link (example - replace with your linker)
ld -o keypress_asm.exe keypress_asm.obj
```

Linux / NASM (ELF 32-bit):
```
nasm -f elf32 keypress_asm.asm -o keypress_asm.o
ld -m elf_i386 -o keypress_asm keypress_asm.o
```

If you want, I can add a small platform-specific build instruction or a Makefile — tell me which assembler/linker you use.
