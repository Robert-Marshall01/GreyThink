# NOTICE

This repository uses the Hugging Face model `google/flan-t5-base` (Apache-2.0).

Required files to include in any redistributed artifact that contains model
weights (e.g., Docker images, wheels, tarballs):

- `licenses/COPYING.APACHE2.txt` (or `models/COPYING.APACHE2.txt`) — full Apache 2.0 license text for the model
- `licenses/google-flan-t5-base.NOTICE.txt` (or `models/google-flan-t5-base.NOTICE.txt`) — model NOTICE file (attribution).
- `CITATION.md` / `CITATION.bib` — suggested citation and BibTeX for the underlying research paper.

Do not assume redistribution is allowed without including these files. If you
modify any model files from upstream, add a prominent notice of changes. Do
not include model weights in this repository; fetch them at runtime using
`transformers.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-base")`. See `PACKAGING_CHECKLIST.md` for details.

This NOTICE is intentionally assertive to make compliance explicit to downstream users.
