# Example commands to exercise the passwd builtin
# Note: passwd prompts interactively for the new password (twice).
# On Windows, if running elevated, Msh will try to invoke `net user USERNAME *` which prompts
# for password interactively in the system tool. When not possible Msh will use a local
# emulated store `.msh_passwd` in the current directory with simple hashes (FNV-1a 64-bit).

# Change current user's password (username omitted):
passwd

# Change another user's password (may require elevation or will update .msh_passwd):
passwd testuser
