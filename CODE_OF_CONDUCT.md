# GreyThink Code of Conduct

Version: 1.1  
Last updated: 2025-12-01

This repository exists to build and share software in a respectful, constructive environment. We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds and expect everyone to follow this Code of Conduct.

Summary: Be respectful. Do not attack, harass, threaten, or intentionally offend others. When in doubt, err on the side of kindness.

---

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all repository spaces and activities related to this project, including:
- Issues, pull requests, and reviews
- Comments on commits and discussions
- Project documentation, wikis, discussion forums, and community spaces
- Direct messages and any official communication channels maintained by the project
- Project-sponsored events (online and in-person) and official social media accounts

---

## Immediate "Do NOTs" (CRITICAL)
The following behaviors are unacceptable and will result in prompt action and reporting when appropriate:
- Targeting people for their race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, or any protected characteristic.
- Threats of violence or threats of any kind against people, their property, or their families.
- Harassment, including targeted or persistent harassment and harassment that includes threats or violence.
- Use of slurs, hateful language, or content intended to demean a protected class or individual.
- Bashing, ridiculing, or attacking others for their beliefs; GitHub is not a battleground for ideological or religious disputes.
- Intentionally offensive comments or jokes meant to provoke, humiliate, or shock.
- Posting, linking to, or embedding graphic imagery or graphic textual descriptions (for example sexual violence or extreme gore).
- Posting someone's very private information such as location, credit card number, SSN, password, or private photos (especially when used as blackmail).

These behaviors are non-negotiable and will be treated as severe violations. They may be reported to GitHub and/or other authorities depending on severity.

---

## Impolite — Please refrain from these
These behaviors may not always trigger immediate reporting, but they degrade the community and should be avoided:
- Excessive profanity, especially explicit sexual or violent expletives.
- Crude or toilet-humor comments that serve no constructive purpose.
- Plain obnoxious behavior: trolling, intentional derailment of discussions, or repeated low-effort disruptions.

When you slip up: apologize, edit or delete the offending content, and learn from it.

---

## Examples of Unacceptable Content
- Threatening someone with punishment for a perceived offense (threat / hateful).
- Using a slur directed at a contributor (hateful).
- Posting an image of graphic violence in an issue to shock maintainers (graphic).
- Repeating the same crude joke in multiple threads after being asked to stop (obnoxious).

---

## Reporting a Violation
If you experience or witness a violation, please report it promptly and provide as much detail as possible.

Preferred reporting options:
1. Public report (if you are comfortable): Create a new issue in this repository titled:
   "Code of Conduct Report: [short description]" and include:
   - The user(s) involved (GitHub usernames)
   - Links to offending comments, issues, PRs, or files (URLs)
   - Date/time (UTC) of the incident
   - A short description of what happened and any relevant context
   - Any screenshots or copies of content (do not alter evidence)
   Note: If you make a public report and want it removed later for privacy, contact the maintainers (see private option below).

2. Private report (recommended if you want confidentiality): Email the maintainers at: MAINTAINER_CONDUCT_EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER
   - Replace MAINTAINER_CONDUCT_EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER with an email address project maintainers decide and manage.
   - If you don't see an address here, contact the primary maintainer via their GitHub handle: @Robert-Marshall01 and request a private reporting channel.

3. If you believe someone is in immediate danger, contact your local authorities right away.

4. You may also report content directly to GitHub using their report flow: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/reporting-abuse-or-policy-violations/reporting-abuse-or-policy-violations-on-github

What to avoid in reports:
- Do not include unrelated personal data about yourself or others beyond what is necessary to document the incident.
- Do not alter evidence; provide screenshots or links to the original content when possible.

---

## Non-retaliation and Confidentiality
- We will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports a violation in good faith or who participates in an investigation.
- We will make reasonable efforts to keep reports confidential. However, some information may need to be shared with project maintainers, GitHub, or law enforcement as part of an investigation.

---

## Enforcement and Consequences
We will review reports promptly and take action appropriate to the severity and frequency of violations. Possible actions include:
- Removal or editing of offending content.
- Private warning to the offending contributor.
- Temporary restriction or temporary ban from contributing (typical durations: 7, 30, or 90 days, depending on severity and recurrence).
- Permanent ban from contributing to this repository.
- Reporting to GitHub for policy violations.
- Reporting to law enforcement when the behavior is unlawful or involves credible threats or violence.

Consequences for CRITICAL violations (the "Do NOTs" listed above):
- Guaranteed permanent ban from contributing and removal of write/comment privileges for severe incidents.
- Reporting to GitHub for policy violations.
- If unlawful or involving credible threats, reporting to law enforcement or other appropriate authorities.

Consequences for Impolite violations ("please refrain" list):
- An initial request to stop the behavior.
- Moderators may require the offending content to be edited or removed.
- If repeated or escalated after warnings, temporary restrictions or temporary bans may be applied.
- Repeated patterns may escalate to more serious enforcement actions.

All enforcement actions will be documented and, where possible, the reporter will be notified of outcomes.

## How Maintainers Handle Reports
- Acknowledgement: We will acknowledge receipt of a report within 72 hours when possible.
- Investigation: We may ask the reporter for additional information and will investigate with discretion.
- Decision and follow-up: We will aim to reach a resolution and inform the reporter of the outcome within a reasonable timeframe (typically within 14 days, though complex cases may take longer).
- Appeals: If you believe enforcement was unfair, open an issue titled "Code of Conduct Appeal: [short description]" and explain why. Appeals will be reviewed by a different maintainer or an appointed review panel where possible.

---

## Respectful Participation Guidelines (Positive guidance)
- Focus discussion on code, design, and facts rather than people.
- Be concise, clear, and constructive in feedback.
- Assume good faith and ask clarifying questions when tone is unclear.
- When you disagree, explain why and offer alternatives.
- Give maintainers and other contributors reasonable time to respond.
