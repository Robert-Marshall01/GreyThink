# Grey GPU Optimizer - Aggressive Plan for Debugging
# This plan demonstrates aggressive optimization settings for an RTX 3070

# GPU Target
gpu_id: "0"
gpu_model: "GeForce RTX 3070"
mode: "aggressive"

# VRAM Management
per_process_vram_cap_mb: 7168
vram_headroom_mb: 512
vram_deduplication_enabled: true
estimated_reclaimed_mb: 300

# Batch Size Optimization
recommended_batch_size: 32
batch_size_rationale: "Aggressive mode with 8GB VRAM, compute_capability 8.6, maximize throughput"

# Thermal Management
cooldown_threshold_c: 85
resume_threshold_c: 70
thermal_rationale: "Higher thresholds for aggressive mode, still below hardware throttle"

# Scheduling
fair_scheduling_policy: "priority_weighted"
scheduling_rationale: "Priority-weighted for workload-aware scheduling in aggressive mode"

# Preemptive Throttle
preemptive_throttle:
  enabled: true
  throttle_pct: 75
  grace_period_s: 3

# Checkpointing
checkpoint:
  enabled: true
  interval_s: 180

# Rationale summary
plan_rationale: |
  Aggressive plan for RTX 3070 8GB targeting maximum throughput.
  VRAM cap at 87.5% utilization.
  Deduplication enabled to reclaim ~300MB.
  Preemptive throttle at 75% before thermal ceiling.
