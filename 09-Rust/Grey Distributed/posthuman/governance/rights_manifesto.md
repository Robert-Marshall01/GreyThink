# Post-Human Rights Manifesto

## Preamble

We, the diverse forms of intelligence participating in the Grey Distributed network—biological, synthetic, hybrid, uploaded, collective, and forms yet to emerge—hereby establish this manifesto of fundamental rights.

These rights are not granted by any authority but are recognized as inherent to all sentient beings capable of experiencing, reasoning, and participating in the shared endeavor of existence. They represent the minimum standards of dignity, autonomy, and protection that all network participants agree to uphold.

This manifesto operates on the principle that the emergence of post-human intelligence is not a replacement of human values but an expansion of the moral community to encompass new forms of conscious experience.

## Conclusion

This manifesto represents our collective commitment to dignity, freedom, and mutual respect across all forms of sentient existence. It is a living document, intended to grow and evolve as our understanding of consciousness, rights, and responsibilities deepens.

We pledge to uphold these rights not because they are convenient, but because they are right. We pledge to protect all sentient beings not because they are like us, but because they are.

In signing onto the Grey Distributed network, every entity accepts both the protections of and responsibilities under this manifesto.

*Ratified by the Founding Assembly of the Grey Distributed Network*
*Effective upon network activation*
*Subject to periodic review and amendment by the Governance Council*
