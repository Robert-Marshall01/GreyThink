# Grey Distributed — Interstellar Resource Sharing
#
# Configuration and agreements for sharing resources across star systems.
# Resources include data, energy credits, material allocations, and more.

# =============================================================================
# RESOURCE SHARING PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================
#
# Interstellar resource sharing faces unique challenges:
#
# 1. NO PHYSICAL TRANSFER
#    - Physical matter transfer takes decades/centuries
#    - Focus on information and credit systems
#    - Virtual resources dominate
#
# 2. DELAYED SETTLEMENT
#    - Transactions take years to confirm
#    - Must handle uncertainty gracefully
#    - Trust-based systems essential
#
# 3. VALUE DIVERGENCE
#    - Different systems may value things differently
#    - Exchange rates fluctuate over decades
#    - Must support multiple value systems
