# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! A few quick guidelines:

- Fork the repo and submit a pull request.
- Ensure your branch builds on Linux and Windows.
- Run `tests/run_sample.sh` (or `tests/run_sample.ps1`) to exercise the non-interactive sample mode.
- Prefer clear commit messages and one feature per PR.

If you find a bug, please open an issue describing steps to reproduce and include your OS and compiler.
