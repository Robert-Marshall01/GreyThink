# Kubernetes Service for clock_asm
# =============================================================================
# Note: This is a headless service since clock_asm is a console application
# that doesn't expose any network ports. The service is included for:
# - Pod discovery within the cluster
# - Consistent naming/DNS for the application
# - Future extensibility if network features are added
