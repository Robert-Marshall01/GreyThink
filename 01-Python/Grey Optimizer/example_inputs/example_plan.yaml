# Grey GPU Optimizer - Example Plan for Debugging
# This plan demonstrates typical optimization settings for an RTX 3070

# GPU Target
gpu_id: "0"
gpu_model: "GeForce RTX 3070"
mode: "safe"

# VRAM Management
per_process_vram_cap_mb: 4096
vram_headroom_mb: 1024
vram_deduplication_enabled: false
estimated_reclaimed_mb: 0

# Batch Size Optimization
recommended_batch_size: 8
batch_size_rationale: "Safe mode with 8GB VRAM, compute_capability 8.6"

# Thermal Management
cooldown_threshold_c: 80
resume_threshold_c: 65
thermal_rationale: "Default safe thresholds for NVIDIA Ampere"

# Scheduling
fair_scheduling_policy: "round_robin"
scheduling_rationale: "Round-robin for fair process distribution in safe mode"

# Preemptive Throttle
preemptive_throttle:
  enabled: false
  throttle_pct: 50
  grace_period_s: 5

# Checkpointing
checkpoint:
  enabled: true
  interval_s: 300
  path: "~/.grey_optimizer/checkpoints/"

# Rationale summary
plan_rationale: |
  Conservative plan for RTX 3070 8GB in safe mode.
  VRAM cap at 50% to leave headroom for system.
  Thermal thresholds at defaults.
  Deduplication disabled in safe mode.
