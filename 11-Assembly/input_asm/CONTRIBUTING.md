# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to make collaboration smoother:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your work.
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
- Use NASM style consistent with the existing file (`section .data`, macros, etc.).
- Provide a short description in your PR describing the change and why it's needed.
- If your change modifies build steps, update the `README.md` and `Makefile`.

If you're unsure where to start, open an issue and describe what you'd like to add or fix.
