msh builtin

Usage: msh <script-file>

Description:
The new builtin `msh` reads the specified script file and executes each non-empty,
non-comment line as a shell command. Lines beginning with `#` (after optional leading
whitespace) are treated as comments and ignored.

Implementation details:
- Implemented as a builtin in `run_builtin_command.c`.
- For each script line, the current `Msh.exe` is invoked with `--run-cmd "<line>"`
  so the line is dispatched through the shell's existing command handling,
  preserving builtin semantics.
- The builtin supports quoted script filenames.

Example:
  msh myscript.sh

Limitations / notes:
- The implementation runs each line in a fresh subprocess; side-effects that rely
  on shell state persisting across lines (like changing the shell's working
  directory with `cd`) will not affect the parent shell.
- Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.
- Script lines are not concatenated; complex shell constructs may not behave
  identically to bash.
