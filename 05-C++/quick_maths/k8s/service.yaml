# Quick Maths - Kubernetes Service
# Service configuration for the C++ console application
# ==============================================================================
#
# NOTE: This service is included for completeness, but since Quick Maths is
# an interactive console application (not a network service), this ClusterIP
# service with no ports is primarily useful for:
# - Service discovery within the cluster
# - Potential future enhancements (e.g., adding a web interface or API)
# - Consistent Kubernetes resource patterns
