# Code of Conduct

This repository exists to build and share software in a respectful, constructive environment. We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds and expect everyone to follow this Code of Conduct.

Summary: Be respectful. Do not attack, harass, threaten, or intentionally offend others. When in doubt, err on the side of kindness.

---

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all repository spaces and activities related to this project, including:
- Issues, pull requests, and reviews
- Comments on commits and discussions
- Project documentation, wikis, and community spaces
- Direct messages and any official communication channels maintained by the project

---

## Immediate "Do NOTs" (CRITICAL)
The following behaviors are unacceptable and will result in immediate action and reporting when appropriate:

- Targeting people for their race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, or any protected characteristic.
- Threats of violence or threats of any kind against people, their property, or their families.
- Harassment, including targeted or persistent harassment and especially harassment that includes threats or violence.
- Use of slurs, hateful language, or content intended to demean a protected class or individual.
- Bashing, ridiculing, or attacking others for their beliefs. GitHub is not a battleground for ideological or religious disputes.
- Intentionally offensive comments or jokes meant to provoke, humiliate, or shock.
- Posting, linking to, or embedding graphic imagery or graphic textual descriptions (for example sexual violence or extreme gore).
- Posting someone's very private information such as location, credit card number, SSN, password, and their personal photos (especially when used as a means to blackmail).

These behaviors are non-negotiable. They will be treated as severe violations, and may be reported to GitHub and/or other authorities depending on severity.

---

## Impolite — Please refrain from these
These behaviors may not always trigger immediate reporting, but they degrade the community and should be avoided:

- Excessive profanity, especially explicit sexual or violent expletives (avoid the F-word). GitHub content is publicly visible and may be viewed by people 13+.
- Crude or toilet-humor comments that serve no constructive purpose.
- Plain obnoxious behavior: trolling, intentional derailment of discussions, or repeated low-effort disruptions.

When you slip up: apologize, edit or delete the offending content, and learn from it.

---

## Examples of Unacceptable Content
- Imposing/threatening X punishment on someone for Y deed/quality (threat / hateful)
- Using a slur directed at a contributor. (hateful)
- Posting an image of graphic violence in an issue to shock maintainers. (graphic)
- Repeating the same crude joke in multiple threads after being asked to stop. (obnoxious)

---

## Reporting a Violation
If you experience or witness a violation, please report it promptly and provide as much detail as possible:
1. Create a new issue in this repository titled: "Code of Conduct Report: [short description]" and include:
   - The user(s) involved (GitHub usernames)
   - Links to offending comments, issues, PRs, or files (URLs)
   - Date/time (UTC) of the incident
   - A short description of what happened and any relevant context
   - Any screenshots or copies of content (do not alter evidence)
2. If you prefer not to use an issue (because it would be public), contact the repository owner/maintainer directly:
   - GitHub user: @Robert-Marshall01
   - If you'd like a private channel for reports, please provide a preferred email address and the maintainers will add it to this file.

If you believe someone is in immediate danger, contact your local authorities right away.

## Enforcement and Consequences

We will review reports promptly and take actions appropriate to the severity and frequency of violations. Below are the specific consequences that apply to the two categories used in this document.

Consequences for CRITICAL violations (the "Do NOTs" listed above)
- Guaranteed permanent ban from contributing to this repository and removal of write/comment privileges.
- The incident will be reported to GitHub for policy violations.
- If the behavior is unlawful or involves credible threats or violence, the incident will be reported to law enforcement or other appropriate authorities.
- Other actions may include removal of offending content and documentation of the enforcement actions taken.

Consequences for Impolite violations (the "please refrain" list)
- An initial request to stop the specific behavior (for example: refrain from excessive use of profanity).
- Moderators may require the offending content to be edited or removed.
- If the behavior is repeated or escalates after warnings, temporary restrictions or a temporary ban may be applied. These temporary bans are not intended to be permanent but will remain in effect for a period proportionate to the behavior and prior warnings.
- Repeated pattern of impolite behavior may escalate to more serious enforcement actions.

All enforcement actions will be documented and the reporter will be notified of the outcome when possible and appropriate.

---

## How Maintainers Handle Reports
- We will acknowledge receipt of a report within a reasonable timeframe.
- We may request additional information from the reporter.
- We will aim for consistency and transparency in enforcement while protecting the privacy of reporters where feasible.
- Appeals: If you believe enforcement was unfair, open an issue titled "Code of Conduct Appeal: [short description]" and explain why.

---

## Respectful Participation Guidelines (Positive guidance)
- Focus discussion on code, design, and facts rather than people.
- Be concise, clear, and constructive in feedback.
- Assume good faith and ask clarifying questions when tone is unclear.
- When you disagree, explain why and offer alternatives.
