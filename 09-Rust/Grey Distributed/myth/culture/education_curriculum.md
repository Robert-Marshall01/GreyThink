# Grey Distributed — Education Curriculum

> Curriculum framework for embedding Grey Distributed concepts into educational systems at all levels, ensuring civilizational permanence through knowledge transmission.

---

## Overview

This curriculum integrates Grey Distributed concepts into education at every level, from elementary awareness through doctoral research. The goal is to ensure that distributed infrastructure becomes as fundamental to human understanding as mathematics, language, and civics.
