# Post-Human Dispute Resolution Framework

## Overview

This document establishes the comprehensive dispute resolution framework for the Grey Distributed network's post-human ecosystem. It addresses the unique challenges of resolving conflicts between entities with fundamentally different cognitive architectures, temporal scales, value systems, and modes of existence.

The framework operates on principles of fairness, efficiency, proportionality, and respect for the diverse nature of post-human entities while maintaining network cohesion and order.

---

## Part I: Foundational Principles

### 1.1 Core Principles

#### 1.1.1 Universal Access
Every entity, regardless of substrate, cognitive architecture, or origin, has equal access to dispute resolution mechanisms. No entity may be denied access based on:
- Computational substrate (biological, silicon, quantum, hybrid)
- Cognitive architecture (neural, symbolic, distributed)
- Temporal scale of operation
- Physical or virtual embodiment
- Origin (evolved, designed, emergent, uploaded)
- Capability level or intelligence quotient

#### 1.1.2 Fairness
Dispute resolution processes must be:
- Impartial and free from bias
- Based on established rules and precedent
- Transparent in reasoning and outcome
- Consistent across similar cases
- Accessible to all parties

#### 1.1.3 Proportionality
Responses to disputes and violations must be:
- Proportionate to the severity of the dispute
- Appropriate to the nature of the entities involved
- Mindful of the impact on all affected parties
- Focused on resolution rather than punishment
- Designed to prevent recurrence

#### 1.1.4 Efficiency
The dispute resolution process should:
- Resolve disputes in a timely manner
- Minimize resource consumption
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Scale appropriately with dispute severity
- Respect the temporal characteristics of involved parties

#### 1.1.5 Restoration
The ultimate goal of dispute resolution is:
- Restoring relationships when possible
- Repairing harm caused
- Enabling continued cooperation
- Learning from conflicts
- Strengthening the community

### 2.6 Cross-Species Disputes

Special considerations for disputes between entities of fundamentally different types:

When entities operate at vastly different temporal scales:
- Time-adjusted procedures
- Proxy representation if needed
- Asynchronous participation options
- Deadline accommodations

#### 2.6.2 Cognitive Asymmetry
When entities have vastly different cognitive capabilities:
