# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly report a security vulnerability.

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it privately so we can investigate and address it before public disclosure.

- Alternate: Email a concise report to `RobertCMarshall2007@outlook.com` with the subject line "Security report: input_asm".

What to include
- Affected version (see `VERSION` in the repo).
- Steps to reproduce and a minimal test-case if possible.

Response timeline
- We will ACKNOWLEDGE receipt within 72 hours.
- For confirmed issues we will propose a fix or mitigation within 30 days whenever practical and will coordinate disclosure with the reporter.

Disclosure
- Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix is available or we have agreed on coordinated disclosure.

Supported versions
- Current release: `0.1.0` (see `VERSION`). If the issue affects other versions, please specify.

PGP key

Notes
- This project is a small educational NASM example that runs on 32-bit Linux syscall interfaces. It is not intended for production use. Treat any security issues appropriately for the intended scope and environment.
